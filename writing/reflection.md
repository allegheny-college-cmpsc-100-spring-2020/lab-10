# Lab 10 Reflection: {Your Name Here}

## Paste the line initializing your ArrayList below in the code block.

```java
```

### What did this structure allow you to do?


### How does our use of the object in this lab mimic a true library?


## Re-read the code that makes up `Book.java` and reflect on its structure. How does it mimic a book and why is it structured using a variety of methods which "set" or "get" various properties of the book?


## Paste the first `while` loop you used in the code block below (including its nested `while`).

```java
```

### Describe how "nesting" works here and why two (2) loops (one inside the other) were required for the program's functionality.


## This lab also required you to use a couple of `Scanner` objects. What were each of them (use the identiifers you created to refer to them) and what were their purposes?


## This lab introduces you to the concept of "data structure." Look at the `inputs/book.list` file and copy and paste a line below in the code block.

```java
```

### Describe the data format of this line. How does the line divide its data? What does each piece represent?
